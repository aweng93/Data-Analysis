# Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree Project
Log Analysis

# Premise
You've been hired onto a team working on a newspaper site. The user-facing newspaper site frontend itself, and the database behind it, are already built and running. You've been asked to build an internal reporting tool that will use information from the database to discover what kind of articles the site's readers like.

The database contains newspaper articles, as well as the web server log for the site. The log has a database row for each time a reader loaded a web page. Using that information, your code will answer questions about the site's user activity.

The program you write in this project will run from the command line. It won't take any input from the user. Instead, it will connect to that database, use SQL queries to analyze the log data, and print out the answers to some questions.

# Required Software

[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - 3.7.3 - Main programming language you will use for this project.
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) - Allows you to create a virtual environment on your computer.
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - Virtualization simulator.
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version Control. Use this to to initialize Vagrant and access the DB-API.

# Setup

To start on this project, you'll need database software (provided by a Linux virtual machine) and the data to analyze.

THE VIRTUAL MACHINE

This project makes use of the same Linux-based virtual machine (VM) as the preceding lessons.

If you skipped those lessons and came right to this project, that's OK! However, you will need to go back to the instructions to install the virtual machine. Please see previous lessons to complete the installation process.

This will give you the PostgreSQL database and support software needed for this project. If you have used an older version of this VM, you may need to install it into a new directory.

If you need to bring the virtual machine back online (with vagrant up), do so now. Then log into it with vagrant ssh.

DOWNLOAD THE DATA

Next, [download the data here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip). You will need to unzip this file after downloading it. The file inside is called newsdata.sql. Put this file into the vagrant directory, which is shared with your virtual machine.

To build the reporting tool, you'll need to load the site's data into your local database. 

To load the data, cd into the vagrant directory and use the command psql -d news -f newsdata.sql.
Here's what this command does:

psql — the PostgreSQL command line program
-d news — connect to the database named news which has been set up for you
-f newsdata.sql — run the SQL statements in the file newsdata.sql
Running this command will connect to your installed database server and execute the SQL commands in the downloaded file, creating tables and populating them with data.

# Log Analysis Objectives

Here are the questions the reporting tool should answer. The example answers given aren't the right ones, though!

1. What are the most popular three articles of all time? Which articles have been accessed the most? Present this information as a sorted list with the most popular article at the top.

Example:

"Princess Shellfish Marries Prince Handsome" — 1201 views
"Baltimore Ravens Defeat Rhode Island Shoggoths" — 915 views
"Political Scandal Ends In Political Scandal" — 553 views

2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time? That is, when you sum up all of the articles each author has written, which authors get the most page views? Present this as a sorted list with the most popular author at the top.

Example:

Ursula La Multa — 2304 views
Rudolf von Treppenwitz — 1985 views
Markoff Chaney — 1723 views
Anonymous Contributor — 1023 views

3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors? The log table includes a column status that indicates the HTTP status code that the news site sent to the user's browser. (Refer to this lesson for more information about the idea of HTTP status codes.)

Example:

July 29, 2016 — 2.5% errors
